The Dutch VAT (BTW) declaration form explained
=====================================

This article is meant to give a simple explanation to the Dutch VAT (BTW) declaration form. This is __not__ an official explanation and thus __no__ legal meaning/responsibility shell be derived.

## General:
* Tax to be paid is rounded down
* Deductable Tax( f.e. paid on a purchase) is rounded up

### 1. Prestaties Binnenland (Inland sales of Goods and Services)

* `1a Leveringen en diensten belast met hoog tarief`.
Here all the net sales should be recorded that are charged at the high rate of 21%
* `1b Leveringen en diensten belast met laag tarief`.
Here all the net sales should be recorded that are charged at the low rate of 21%
* `1c Leveringen en diensten belast met overige tarieven, behalve 0%`.
This line is for all net sales at at a different rate other than 0%. Think of the special rate of 11% for sportcantines.
* `1d Prive-gebruik`.
This line is meant for the private usage of company goods (f.e. private usage of a companycar, private usage of company-telephone), the net value and the VAT. Example: List-price of the car € 30,000,- Private usage is calculated at between 0% and 25% of list-price of the car. The percentage is depending on the Co2-emission value of the car. The VAT itself is nowadays 2,7% of the list-price
* `1e Leveringen/diensten belast met 0% of niet bij u belast`.
This line is for all sales that are exempt of VAT. Think f.e. of medical services, services related to insurances and insurance policies.

### 2. Verleggingsregelingen binnenland

* `2a Leveringen/diensten waarbij de heffing van omzetbelasting naar u is verlegd`.
This is a very special and rare category. I don’t think there will be any user of Manager in the Netherlands that has to deal with this category

### 3. Prestaties naar of in het buitenland

* `3a Levering naar landen buiten de EU (uitvoer)`.
This category is for all sales of goods and services outside the EU. The only thing that needs to be reported on the tax-form is the net sales-value of all transaction.
* `3b Leveringen naar of diensten in landen binnen de EU`.
This category is for the B2B sales to EU customers. Only the sales value has to be recorded The sale itself is not charged with VAT. A sale to a private person inside the EU is considered to be an inland sale and therefor charged with VAT
* `3c Installatie/afstandsverkopen binnen de EU`.
This is, like 2a, a very special and rare category. I don’t think there will be any user of Manager in the Netherlands that has to deal with this category

### 4. Prestaties vanuit het buitenland aan u verricht

When a business imports goods or services, the corresponding VAT over the imported value should be paid at the moment of import to the tax-authorities. This paid VAT is however deductible at section 5b. Say the imported value is € 1,000.- I pay at the border 21% is € 210.- and I deduct € 210.- at 5b The final balance is € 0.-. The overcome the administrative hassle this brings, there is a rule for businesses that when they import goods or services, they don’t have to pay the import VAT at the border, but it is postponed until the return the VAT-tax-form.
* `4a Levering/diensten uit landen buiten de EU`.
When goods or services are imported from outside the EU, you have to report the net value of these transactions and the corresponding VAT. At the same moment the VAT amount is deducted at 5b. The VAT balance for these transactions is zero.
* `4b Levering/diensten uit landen binnen de EU`.
When the goods or services are imported from a country inside the EU you have to report the net value of these transactions at 4b as well as the corresponding VAT. At the same moment the VAT amount is deducted at 5b. The VAT balance for these transactions is zero.

### 5. Voorbelasting en kleine ondernemersregeling

* `5a Omzetbelasting (rubrieken 1 t/m 4)`.
Here you have to the subtotal of the VAT-totals from sections 1 till 4
* `5b Voorbelasting`.
This line shows the paid VAT-totals (Vat paid to suppliers and recorded as deductible + plus the VAT amounts of line 4a and 4b)
* `5c Subtotaal (rubriek 5a min 5b)`
This is the subtotal of 5a minus 5b
* `5d Vermindering volgens de kleine ondernemersregeling`
In case (on annual basis) the total tax amount to be paid at line 5c , is less less than € 1345.- Dutch VAT-law says that this amount is cleared. So the business doesn't have to pay this amount at all. When the total at line 5c is between an amount of € 1345.- and 1884,- a certain part of this amount has to be paid and when the annual amount is higher than € 1884.- the VAT should be paid in full. Anyway the amount that is cleared has to be shown in the P&L as a profit. This rule is also known as KOR.
* `5e and 5f Schatting etc`
This line is of no importance. With a special permit, you are allowed to send in VAT tax forms with estimates. These permits are only given in very very rare situations.
5g Totaal
This is the total of 5c minus 5d, 5e and 5f
